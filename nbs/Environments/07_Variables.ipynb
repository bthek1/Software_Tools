    "\n",
    "- **Use uppercase names*: By convention, environment variable names are uppercase to distinguish them from shell variables.\n",

    "- **Be cautious with `PATH`*: When modifying `PATH`, append directories rather than replacing its value to avoid overwriting existing paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure sensitive data*: Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords directly in environment variables. Use secure methods for handling such data.\n",
