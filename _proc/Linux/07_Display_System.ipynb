    "\n",
    "✔ Mature, stable, compatible with decades of software\n",
    "✔ Remote network rendering works very well (e.g., `ssh -X`, X forwarding)\n",
    "✔ Extremely configurable, many window managers (i3, Awesome, bspwm)\n",
    "\n",
    "✘ Performance overhead — multiple round-trips between client & server\n",
