    "> The `uv` environment manager is a modern, high-performance Python package and project manager written in Rust. Designed to replace tools like `pip`, `virtualenv`, `pyenv`, and `poetry`, `uv` offers a unified interface for managing Python environments, dependencies, and versions. It's known for its speed, efficiency, and ease of use citeturn0search1.\n",
